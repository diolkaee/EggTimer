Always boil your egg to your delight! The app timer calculates the perfect boiling time for your desired consistency using Charles D. H. Williams formula (https://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/egg/).
This App is not ready for publish but rather a demo space for experimenting with Jetpack Compose and MVI architecture.
